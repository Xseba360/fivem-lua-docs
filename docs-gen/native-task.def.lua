--- Modes:  
--- 0 - ignore heading  
--- 1 - park forward  
--- 2 - park backwards  
--- Depending on the angle of approach, the vehicle can park at the specified heading or at its exact opposite (-180) angle.  
--- Radius seems to define how close the vehicle has to be -after parking- to the position for this task considered completed. If the value is too small, the vehicle will try to park again until it's exactly where it should be. 20.0 Works well but lower values don't, like the radius is measured in centimeters or something.

--- Differs from TASK_VEHICLE_DRIVE_TO_COORDS in that it will pick the shortest possible road route without taking one-way streets and other "road laws" into consideration.  
--- WARNING:  
--- A behaviorFlag value of 0 will result in a clunky, stupid driver!  
--- Recommended settings:  
--- speed = 30.0f,  
--- behaviorFlag = 156,   
--- stoppingRange = 5.0f;  
--- If you simply want to have your driver move to a fixed location, call it only once, or, when necessary in the event of interruption.   
--- If using this to continually follow a Ped who is on foot:  You will need to run this in a tick loop.  Call it in with the Ped's updated coordinates every 20 ticks or so and you will have one hell of a smart, fast-reacting NPC driver -- provided he doesn't get stuck.  If your update frequency is too fast, the Ped may not have enough time to figure his way out of being stuck, and thus, remain stuck.  One way around this would be to implement an "anti-stuck" mechanism, which allows the driver to realize he's stuck, temporarily pause the tick, unstuck, then resume the tick.

--- pilot, vehicle and altitude are rather self-explanatory.  
--- p4: is unused variable in the function.  
--- entityToFollow: you can provide a Vehicle entity or a Ped entity, the heli will protect them.  
--- 'targetSpeed':  The pilot will dip the nose AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE so as to reach this value AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.  As such, you'll want to modulate it as opposed to calling it via a hard-wired, constant #.  
--- 'radius' isn't just "stop within radius of X of target" like with ground vehicles.  In this case, the pilot will fly an entire circle around 'radius' and continue to do so.  
--- NOT CONFIRMED:  p7 appears to be a FlyingStyle enum.  Still investigating it as of this writing, but playing around with values here appears to result in different -behavior- as opposed to offsetting coordinates, altitude, target speed, etc.  
--- NOTE: If the pilot finds enemies, it will engage them until it kills them, but will return to protect the ped/vehicle given shortly thereafter.

--- EDITED (7/13/2017)  
--- NOTE: If you want air combat, AI::TASK_COMBAT_PED (while your pilot is in an aircraft) also does the same thing as this native.  
--- DESCRIPTION:  
--- Ever wish your buddy could shoot down one of your enemies for you? Ever wanted an auto-pilot? Well look no further! This is the native for you! (Ped intelligence may vary)  
--- USAGE:  
--- -- REQUIRED --  
--- • pilot = The ped flying the aircraft.  
--- • aircraft = The aircraft the pilot is flying  
--- -- OPTIONAL -- [atleast 1 must be assigned]  
--- • targetVehicle = The vehicle the pilot will target.  
--- • targetPed = The ped the pilot will target.  
--- • destinationX, destinationY, destinationZ = The location the pilot will target.  
--- -- LOGIC --  
--- • missionFlag = The type of mission. pastebin.com/R8x73dbv  
--- • angularDrag = The higher the value, the slower the plane will rotate. Value ranges from 0 - Infinity.  
--- • unk = Set to 0, and you'll be fine.  
--- • targetHeading = The target angle (from world space north) that the pilot will try to acheive before executing an attack/landing.  
--- • maxZ = Maximum Z coordinate height for flying.  
--- • minZ = Minimum Z coordinate height for flying.  
--- Z: 2,700 is the default max height a pilot will be able to fly. Anything greater and he will fly downward until reaching 2,700 again.  
--- Mission Types (incase you don't like links..):  
--- 0 = None  
--- 1 = Unk  
--- 2 = CTaskVehicleRam  
--- 3 = CTaskVehicleBlock  
--- 4 = CTaskVehicleGoToPlane  
--- 5 = CTaskVehicleStop  
--- 6 = CTaskVehicleAttack  
--- 7 = CTaskVehicleFollow  
--- 8 = CTaskVehicleFleeAirborne  
--- 9 = CTaskVehicleCircle  
--- 10 = CTaskVehicleEscort  
--- 15 = CTaskVehicleFollowRecording  
--- 16 = CTaskVehiclePoliceBehaviour  
--- 17 = CTaskVehicleCrash  
--- Example C#:  
--- Function.Call(Hash.TASK_PLANE_MISSION, pilot, vehicle, 0, Game.Player.Character, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0f, 0f, 0f, 2500.0f, -1500f);

--- Needs working example. Doesn't seem to do anything.
--- I marked p2 as targetVehicle as all these shooting related tasks seem to have that in common.
--- I marked p6 as distanceToShoot as if you think of GTA's Logic with the native SET_VEHICLE_SHOOT natives, it won't shoot till it gets within a certain distance of the target.
--- I marked p7 as pedAccuracy as it seems it's mostly 100 (Completely Accurate), 75, 90, etc. Although this could be the ammo count within the gun, but I highly doubt it. I will change this comment once I find out if it's ammo count or not.

--- Note: I've only tested it on entity -> ped and target -> vehicle. It could work differently on other entities, didn't try it yet.

--- In every case of this native, I've only seen the first parameter passed as 0, although I believe it's a Ped after seeing tasks around it using 0. That's because it's used in a Sequence Task.  
--- The last 3 parameters are definitely coordinates after seeing them passed in other scripts, and even being used straight from the player's coordinates.  
--- ---  
--- It seems that - in the decompiled scripts - this native was used on a ped who was in a vehicle to throw a projectile out the window at the player. This is something any ped will naturally do if they have a throwable and they are doing driveby-combat (although not very accurately).  
--- It is possible, however, that this is how SWAT throws smoke grenades at the player when in cover.  
--- ----------------------------------------------------  
--- The first comment is right it definately is the ped as if you look in script finale_heist2b.c line 59628 in Xbox Scripts atleast you will see task_throw_projectile and the first param is Local_559[2 <14>] if you look above it a little bit line 59622 give_weapon_to_ped uses the same exact param Local_559[2 <14>] and we all know the first param of that native is ped. So it guaranteed has to be ped. 0 just may mean to use your ped by default for some reason.

--- The ped will walk or run towards goToLocation, aiming towards goToLocation or focusLocation (depending on the aimingFlag) and shooting if shootAtEnemies = true to any enemy in his path.
--- If the ped is closer than noRoadsDistance, the ped will ignore pathing/navmesh and go towards goToLocation directly. This could cause the ped to get stuck behind tall walls if the goToLocation is on the other side. To avoid this, use 0.0f and the ped will always use pathing/navmesh to reach his destination.
--- If the speed is set to 0.0f, the ped will just stand there while aiming, if set to 1.0f he will walk while aiming, 2.0f will run while aiming.
--- The ped will stop aiming when he is closer than distanceToStopAt to goToLocation.
--- I still can't figure out what unkTrue is used for. I don't notice any difference if I set it to false but in the decompiled scripts is always true.
--- I think that unkFlag, like the driving styles, could be a flag that "work as a list of 32 bits converted to a decimal integer. Each bit acts as a flag, and enables or disables a function". What leads me to this conclusion is the fact that in the decompiled scripts, unkFlag takes values like: 0, 1, 5 (101 in binary) and 4097 (4096 + 1 or 1000000000001 in binary). For now, I don't know what behavior enable or disable this possible flag so I leave it at 0.
--- Note: After some testing, using unkFlag = 16 (0x10) enables the use of sidewalks while moving towards goToLocation.
--- The aimingFlag takes 2 values: 0 to aim at the focusLocation, 1 to aim at where the ped is heading (goToLocation).
--- Example:
--- enum AimFlag
--- {
---    AimAtFocusLocation,
---    AimAtGoToLocation
--- };
--- Vector3 goToLocation1 = { 996.2867f, 0, -2143.044f, 0, 28.4763f, 0 }; // remember the padding.
--- Vector3 goToLocation2 = { 990.2867f, 0, -2140.044f, 0, 28.4763f, 0 }; // remember the padding.
--- Vector3 focusLocation = { 994.3478f, 0, -2136.118f, 0, 29.2463f, 0 }; // the coord z should be a little higher, around +1.0f to avoid aiming at the ground
--- // 1st example
--- TASK::TASK_GO_TO_COORD_AND_AIM_AT_HATED_ENTITIES_NEAR_COORD(pedHandle, goToLocation1.x, goToLocation1.y, goToLocation1.z, focusLocation.x, focusLocation.y, focusLocation.z, 2.0f /*run*/, true /*shoot*/, 3.0f /*stop at*/, 0.0f /*noRoadsDistance*/, true /*always true*/, 0 /*possible flag*/, AimFlag::AimAtGoToLocation, -957453492 /*FullAuto pattern*/);
--- // 2nd example
--- TASK::TASK_GO_TO_COORD_AND_AIM_AT_HATED_ENTITIES_NEAR_COORD(pedHandle, goToLocation2.x, goToLocation2.y, goToLocation2.z, focusLocation.x, focusLocation.y, focusLocation.z, 1.0f /*walk*/, false /*don't shoot*/, 3.0f /*stop at*/, 0.0f /*noRoadsDistance*/, true /*always true*/, 0 /*possible flag*/, AimFlag::AimAtFocusLocation, -957453492 /*FullAuto pattern*/);
--- 1st example: The ped (pedhandle) will run towards goToLocation1. While running and aiming towards goToLocation1, the ped will shoot on sight to any enemy in his path, using "FullAuto" firing pattern. The ped will stop once he is closer than distanceToStopAt to goToLocation1.
--- 2nd example: The ped will walk towards goToLocation2. This time, while walking towards goToLocation2 and aiming at focusLocation, the ped will point his weapon on sight to any enemy in his path without shooting. The ped will stop once he is closer than distanceToStopAt to goToLocation2.

--- After looking at some scripts the second parameter seems to be an id of some kind. Here are some I found from some R* scripts:
--- "miss_Tower_01" (this went from 01 - 10)
--- "miss_Ass0" (0, 4, 6, 3)
--- "MISS_PATROL_8"
--- I think they're patrol routes, but I'm not sure. And I believe the 3rd parameter is a BOOL, but I can't confirm other than only seeing 0 and 1 being passed.
--- As far as I can see the patrol routes names such as "miss_Ass0" have been defined earlier in the scripts. This leads me to believe we can defined our own new patrol routes by following the same approach.

--- Needs more research.
--- Default value of p13 is -1.0 or 0xBF800000.
--- Default value of p14 is 0.
--- Modified examples from "fm_mission_controller.ysc", line ~203551:
--- TASK::TASK_HELI_MISSION(ped, vehicle, 0, 0, posX, posY, posZ, 4, 1.0, -1.0, -1.0, 10, 10, 5.0, 0);
--- TASK::TASK_HELI_MISSION(ped, vehicle, 0, 0, posX, posY, posZ, 4, 1.0, -1.0, -1.0, 0, ?, 5.0, 4096);
--- int mode seams to set mission type 4 = coords target, 23 = ped target.
--- int 14 set to 32 = ped will land at destination.
--- My findings:
--- mode 4 or 7 forces heli to snap to the heading set
--- 8 makes the heli flee from the ped.
--- 9 circles around ped with angle set
--- 10, 11 normal + imitate ped heading
--- 20 makes the heli land when he's near the ped. It won't resume chasing.
--- 21 emulates an helicopter crash
--- 23 makes the heli circle erratically around ped
--- I change p2 to 'vehicleToFollow' as it seems to work like the task natives to set targets. In the heli_taxi script where as the merryweather heli takes you to your waypoint it has no need to follow a vehicle or a ped, so of course both have 0 set.
